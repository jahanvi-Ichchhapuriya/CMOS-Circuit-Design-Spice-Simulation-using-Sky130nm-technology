We will calculte the Gain: </br>

* **Vdd=1.8V** </br>

## Static behaviour evaluation-CMOS inverter robustness-Device variation

### L1 Sources of variation - Etching process
We will see the sources of variation of VTC characteristics in a CMOS inverter.</br>
First is **Etching Process** </br>
If we see a single inverter layout, we will see the length of gate, the width(common area between polysilicon and diffusion). Due to etching process there can be a variation in length and width of CMOS.

Now considering the inverter chain, the variation can differ with different inverter.
